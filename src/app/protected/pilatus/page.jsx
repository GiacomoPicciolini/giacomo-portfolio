          In collaboration with other Design Teams, we built the companyâ€™s first
          Design System.
          <br />
          <br />
          My first Goal was to analyze how to incorporate Design discipline into
          an already well-defined development process, with a V-Based approach,
          and established work phases that include System Engineers, Project
          Managers, and V&V.
          <br />
          <br />
          We used the Google Design Sprint methodology, tailoring the process to
          fit our needs and expectations, as a baseline to create our own design
          process. Introducing workshops, User Research, and collaborating with
          other departments, we were able to fit Design into the Pilatus
          Lifecycle, seeing immediate results and improvements in the products
          under development.

          <p>THE DESIGN</p>
        </div>
        <p className={styles.secondaryText}>
          I have designed the UX and UI of 3 completely new products: Academy
          TMS, Interactive Wallboards, and Familiarization Learning CBT.
          <br />
          <br />
          Besides that, a full redesign of existing products like Mission
          Planner and Debrief, and Computer Based Training, was completed to
          visually unify them and add new features and functionalities that
          allowed an exchange of data and full integration.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thanks to user research, I tackled complicated topics such as design
          for VR, and learned how end users could influence design choices. The
          research and testing allowed us to simplify the User Journey as much
          as possible in very complicated management software, used by many
          Aviation Academies worldwide.

          <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
        </div>
        <p className={styles.secondaryText}>
          Through the design of new products, we have managed to increase the
          satisfaction rate of current customers, extending existing contracts
          and signing deals with 3 new Training Academies.
          <br />
          <br />
          Working with focus groups and surveys, we confirmed how product
          usability has increased exponentially and how the Pilatus brand is now
          universally recognized across all its products.
          <br />
          <br />
          The biggest challenge was to introduce design discipline in a strongly
          established engineers/aviation environment, educating people to a new
          perspective based on agile methods, user-centered design, and
          iterative approaches.
          <br />
          <br />
          This experience taught me how to find creative solutions to problems
          often unique to design projects, such as technical limitations of an
          app or the inability to use common User Research methodologies.
